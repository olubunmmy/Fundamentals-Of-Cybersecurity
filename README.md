# Cybersecurity Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains a compilation of my final projects from the **Digital SkillUp Africa - Fundamentals of Cybersecurity** program powered by **The Incubator Hub**. Each project demonstrates a different area of hands-on cybersecurity knowledge, including network simulation, digital forensics, and security policy implementation.

These projects were completed as part of my course wrap-up and showcase both practical skills and theoretical understanding of key cybersecurity concepts.

## 2. Android Forensic Image Analysis

**Description:**  
This project involved the forensic analysis of an Android device image. I extracted digital artifacts such as SMS, call logs, browser history, and application data, then reconstructed a timeline of user activity and compiled a professional forensic report.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Forensic investigation techniques  
- Data extraction from Android images  
- SQLite database analysis  
- Timeline reconstruction and integrity validation

## 3. Virtual Firewall Simulation

**Description:**  
This project simulates an enterprise-grade firewall in a virtual lab. The firewall was configured with access control policies, NAT, and intrusion detection. Network activity was logged and analyzed following a simulated attack scenario.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**  
- Firewall deployment and rule configuration  
- Network security policy enforcement  
- Log analysis and simulation of real-world threats  
- Understanding of segmentation and perimeter defense
